Key Metrics:

The dataset reflects a total sales volume of $2.30 million, profits amounting to $286.40k, and a quantity sold of 38,000 units. These key figures provide a broad overview of the business's success.

Furniture: 6.44%
Technology: 50%
Office Supplies: 42%
Understanding profit distribution by category is crucial for strategic decision-making and resource allocation.
Profit Analysis by Segment:

4 Segmenting profits by customer segments offered further insights into the business's performance in different market segments:
Home Segment: 21.05%

This breakdown allows for a targeted approach in addressing specific customer segments and tailoring strategies accordingly.

West: 37.8%
South: 16.32%
